						Most people think of Las Vegas as the epitome of glitz and glammer: America's Adult Playground. They picture slot machines,
						exploding volcanoes and a light beam that shoots into space. But, this page is about something truly exciting: the
						underlying Math and Probabilty that make Las Vegas
						<strong>"America's Math Playground"</strong> (not an official title).

						<p>
							Maximizing profit in Las Vegas is as dependant on exploiting the gambler's fallacy (a misuse of the Law of Large Numbers)
							as it is on boutique hotels and showgirls. Every new game that goes on the casino floor, every wrinkle to the rules
							of blackjack or roulette, and every new slot machine that gets placed has been thoroughly vetted by statisticians
							who calculate the exact amount of profit to be made for every dollar wagered
							<em>in the long run</em> (a correct use of the Law of Large Numbers, or Bernoulli's Theorem).
						</p>
						<p>
							Probability has been connected to gambling since its inception. In fact, Classical Probability Theory came about when two
							scientists (Pascal and Fermat) were presented a question about a gambling problem.
						</p>
						<p>
							Below you will find a timeline that connects gambling, probability and Vegas.
						</p>
						<p>
							And, if you want to see probability and gambling in action (play money only!), try out my mobile-friendly video poker game
							that includes an EV calculator. Ever wonder whether it is better to keep a pair or draw for the flush? This will tell
							you the average return (EV) for each hold combination so you can always make the best decision!
							<br>To play, just click the image of the game on this page.

					<li>
						<strong>3000+bc</strong> - First known usage of dice, found in Egyptian tombs and other ancient locations across the world.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>1400s</strong> - Baccarat is created, making it one of the oldest casino games.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>1524</strong> - Gerolamo Cardano writes the first mathematical treatment of probability, although it was not published
						until 1633.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>1601</strong> - An early version of Blackjack called
						<em>ventiuna (21)</em> is referenced in a book by Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, the author of Don Quixote.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>1638</strong> - The Ridotta, a gambling house and the forefather of the modern casino is opened in Venice, Italy. Amazingly,
						it is still in operation today, making it the world's oldest casino.

						<strong>1654</strong> - Blaise Pascal and Pierre de Fermat begin a correspondence to analyze a gambling problem. This discussion
						is considered the birth of Classical Probability Theory.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>1657</strong> - Christian Huygens, a Dutch scientist, publishes the first book on probability, entitled De Ratiociniis
						in Ludo Aleae. It focuses on probability as it relates to gambling. The book is a big success and, eventually, leads
						to probability becoming a rigorous mathematical discipline.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>1713</strong> - Jacob Bernoulli writes
						<em>The Art of Prediction</em>, which introduces a number of principles including the Law of Large Numbers (hence Bernoulli's
						Theorem).
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>1796</strong> - Roulette, as we know it today, appears in Parisian gaming houses.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>1829</strong> - Poker appears in New Orleans. While the provenance of the game is murky, this is the first known appearance
						of the game in the United States.

					<li>
						<strong>1891</strong> - The first slot machines appear in New York.
					</li>
					<li>

						<strong>1931</strong> - Nevada legalizes gambling. With gambling illegal in the rest of the country, Las Vegas soon becomes
						the center of gambling in the United States.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>1946</strong> - The Flamingo Hotel, the first luxury hotel on the strip opens. While an initial failure, it opens
						the door for many more destination resorts in Vegas.
						<em>"The West's Greatest Resort Hotel</em>" costs $6 million and houses 105 rooms.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>1989</strong> - The Mirage casino opens on the strip. At the time, it is the world's largest and most expensive hotel,
						sporting 3,044 rooms and a construction cost of $630 million. The era of the Vegas mega-resort continues to this day.
